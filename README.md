# eBrew-Godot
The eBrew mockup brought to life through Godot

This is a work in progress recreation of https://gbatemp.net/threads/wii-u-new-hbl-gui-concept-new-name-ebrew-store.602363/ which aims for full recreation of all the intended functionality (Homebrew Launcher + Homebrew App Store). Until Godot gets ported to Wii U, this project will be limited to desktop platforms as a frontend for the Homebrew App Store (maybe with a future feature to FTP downloads to a Wii U?)

As well as recreating the original concept, I've also made some minor changes. So far, this includes custom background image support (put a `background.png` in the `Userfiles` folder.

PS: If you happen to have the orignal assets of the mockup, let me know and/or make a pull request to add them to the repo, because right now I'm just working with assets I edited out of the few screenshots posted in the above GBATemp thread.

To run this, download the files into a folder and then then add that folder to your project list in Godot 4.1
